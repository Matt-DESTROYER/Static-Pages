# Skeleton Loading

Skeleton loading is something you will find in many popular web pages.
Skeleton loading involves using placeholder content that represents the content that hasn't yet loaded to populate a web page.

This web page simulates a web app where many articles or items are displayed with a logo, title, cover, description and footer.
All of the text is fetched from a local file called `content.json`.
This file, along with all image assets (which are all created by me, [@MattDESTROYER](https://replit.com/@MattDESTROYER)) is located in a folder named `Data`.

Feel free to use or adapt the skeleton loading I've created here, but don't forget to give me ([@MattDESTROYER](https://replit.com/@MattDESTROYER)) credit for it.
